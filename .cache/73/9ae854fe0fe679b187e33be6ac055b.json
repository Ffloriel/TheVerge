       He had no natural breath to speak of, so he extinguished the candle flame\n        with his thumb and forefinger and felt nothing on the smooth pads of his \n        fingers. A little bit of the burning light diminished in the quiet chapel,\n        and the shadows and other occupants became indistinguishable in his periphery.\n        The man inside the open coffin wore a black suit, a white shirt crisp like\n        the morning, and a narrow black tie. His hands folded across his abdomen \n        as if he was waiting politely for a meal. His pale skin and false blush \n        had the smooth flawlessness of a seimei, of something artificial. This is\n        not how you look in life. This is not human life.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        A sterile scent permeated the chapel as if to keep all of the people now\n        occupying it in a germless fervor. Someone sitting near the wall tapestry\n        shifted. Another sighed in counterpoint and coughed. It had the cadence\n        of impatience. He took his time in the sepulchral shadows and with the \n        body. He wondered why Jasmina had not burned the body. He was not aware\n        that they were religious, but death had a way of conjuring latent beliefs.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Outside, the blue arch of the sky hung littered by the buzz of vehicles \n        and the impaling of old-world skyscrapers so straight they gave the \n        silhouette of riders on horseback. Smoky clouds seemed to drip from the \n        steel peaks. He felt the unforgiving stone of the church steps as he sat\n        and lit a cig. It was not habit, but ritual, something he adopted from \n        living with Rafael. Life left bodies like that, and it was a truth he \n        knew since the spark. He thought about how there were different levels \n        of knowing, like how there were different levels of consciousness, and \n        perhaps he should not have felt so caught off guard. Pedestrians both \n        human and seimei crossed in front of him, a bubbling of murmurs following \n        in their wake like mental froth. Life led on with Gaian impunity.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Inside the church, mordant music rang. It sounded like a rebuke of death,\n        or perhaps a conspiracy with it. He put his fingers in the holy water, \n        then rubbed the clear liquid between his fingers to make the cold sink in.\n        Stained glass cast soft pieces of rainbow across the mosaic floor.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        He stared at it until people began to trickle out the chapel doors. Some \n        passed him like he was one of the graven images carved into the columns.\n        Others glanced like he was a ghost they dared not acknowledge for fear of\n        a cursing. He did not see Jasmina; she remained with the body. Far overhead,\n        a flyboy gunned their burners and brayed between the bank towers flanking \n        either side of the church. Sirens followed. Another seimei paused \n        imperceptibly, and he recognized her from Rafael’s household.\n      </p>\n      <p><em>“Yada cook,”</em>he sent at the seimei in their language.</p>\n      <p><em>“Sa.”</em></p>\n      <p><em>“Eede lavo yadi munge.”</em></p>\n      <p>\n        The seimei walked on, but her gold eyes blinked her thanks, and that was\n        all they communicated to each other. She held a black hat with a single \n        yellow feather in her hands, and she placed it on her head as the heavy \n        church doors opened to the street and the high traffic rumble rolled \n        inside like a call of thunder.\n      </p>\n      <p><em>Lavo. </em>His fingertips were still wet from the holy water. He tasted it, and it \n        was vaguely salty. His tongue was fashioned to detect taste even if he \n        never had to eat. Waiting at the curb, the car hummed to take him to his\n        flight.\n      </p>\n      <figure>\n        <picture>\n          <source srcset=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ffvUYmjSJiDi3FKk1QwvxZc01BE=/0x0:2040x855/320x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x855):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13731489/VRG_ILLO_2691_ASWAS_001.jpg 320w,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pzgpdLUsGCFQ1VGe5QKXNjl5gBc=/0x0:2040x855/520x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x855):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13731489/VRG_ILLO_2691_ASWAS_001.jpg 520w,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xAnJkDK2Aj8ep9ep4dx5SJ896RM=/0x0:2040x855/720x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x855):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13731489/VRG_ILLO_2691_ASWAS_001.jpg 720w,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zxVyrPcmlo7SatS9rlmATOeJC4w=/0x0:2040x855/920x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x855):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13731489/VRG_ILLO_2691_ASWAS_001.jpg 920w,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3J34mCbcy6s9LgL0jmRy4bopJrE=/0x0:2040x855/1120x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x855):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13731489/VRG_ILLO_2691_ASWAS_001.jpg 1120w,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WzYy4pGuNNY6iFPZpPqJif3xNCY=/0x0:2040x855/1320x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x855):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13731489/VRG_ILLO_2691_ASWAS_001.jpg 1320w,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HB26EQrLBeLSC_xWc84VlH5kVdQ=/0x0:2040x855/1520x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x855):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13731489/VRG_ILLO_2691_ASWAS_001.jpg 1520w,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ln7VY9ePK-cajafYF3debWsAtnk=/0x0:2040x855/1720x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x855):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13731489/VRG_ILLO_2691_ASWAS_001.jpg 1720w,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nipZJV7m9RKKUTScjShUrOC2Quw=/0x0:2040x855/1920x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x855):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13731489/VRG_ILLO_2691_ASWAS_001.jpg 1920w\"><img src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ogmvEqQ55e0TgSGtk-6dsRef77c=/0x0:2040x855/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x855):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13731489/VRG_ILLO_2691_ASWAS_001.jpg\">\n        </picture>\n      </figure>\n      <p>\n        The town at night looked like a microgrid, green and blinking, as the \n        shuttle banked on its descent. Beyond the grid was lightless Alaskan \n        wilderness beholden to nothing but what the Earth provided. Cold \n        penetrated even his outer layers of skin and jacket, and beyond the \n        spike of the port tower, he picked up the howling of wolves. Hamza met\n        him in the lift, and immediately they descended. He watched the night \n        sink outside the glass like the shutting of an eyelid, and his faint \n        reflection superimposed upon it like some restless specter in a horror \n        movie.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Hamza’s image was a blur of orange coveralls and vague triangles of mission \n        patches. He could still hear the wolves howl, even through the glass. \n        Rafael had taken him many times out to the boreal thickness of the interior, \n        and they’d watched the brown bears swipe for salmon in the raging rivers, \n        their great paws some extension of predatory agility and natural power. \n        Wild things never felt sorry for themselves.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        “But how would you know?” he’d said to Rafael. “Humans have not been wild \n        for some time.”\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        He’d seen the bears starve through the winter months and, upon the breaking \n        of an Arctic spring, further north. Though humanity and seimei had staved \n        the disintegration of their common environments, some things remained too \n        damaged to fix. The sea ice whittled fragile into the cold waters, and the \n        bears could no longer chase their food. Majestic creatures reduced to some \n        thinning of themselves. Rafael had looked like that in the coffin, like he’d \n        been stripped of his birthright to hunt and thrive.\n      </p>\n      <q>\n        Though humanity and seimei had staved the disintegration of their common \n        environments, some things remained too damaged to fix\n      </q>\n      <p>“How was it?” Hamza sent to him in the human language.</p>\n      <p>“Strange.”</p>\n      <p>“How so?”</p>\n      <p>“I think I understand.”</p>\n      <p>\n        The doors opened. They moved through to the command offices. The walls were \n        lit like daylight in high winter, and their boots cracked bass notes on the \n        white floors like they were walking on ice.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Some seimei liked to think that they’d liberated the whole world and its \n        creatures, but such thinking made them no more sacrosanct. There had been \n        long generations of humans who had fought to keep the planet whole and its \n        people fed. Just one generation previous, some seimei fit for such things \n        had merely taken up the call, but the call was not from the humans only, \n        but from the planet itself. Human, bear, or butterfly, the plentiful \n        species and iterations of species that now populated the Earth were perhaps \n        given second wind because of the seimei and their creators, the AI scientists \n        from allied nations, but the mistake had always been thinking they were separate, \n        species from species. This physical distinction was most obvious to the least \n        important, but even in their understanding of DNA and consciousness, humanity \n        sought still to divide while making themselves more like the adjacent life \n        they ran headlong to birth in sparks: the seimei.\n      </p>\n      <p class=\"has-dropcap large\">\n        He met Jasmina at the town bar the next night after she had flown in. \n        The owner was ambivalent toward seimei and preferred human customers \n        who ate and drank, but this was a place she and Rafael had liked, so \n        he didn’t protest. Her eyes were still lined by grief, and those \n        tributaries might never fade. He did not forget how she, as well as \n        Rafael, had put him on this path to Enlil. “You’re too curious for \n        house management,” Rafael had said.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Jasmina shook out a couple of cigs and passed him one, and he held \n        it between his lips and bowed his head so she could light it with \n        the flicker. They both tilted their heads back and drew on their cigs \n        before blowing out clean smoke that hung below the overhead lamp and \n        over their heads like cartoon thought balloons.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        “I missed this,” she said, and Benjamin knew she didn’t mean sitting \n        in a bar with him. Even though the smoke was harmless, it was not \n        chemical-free, and she had not been able to smoke during the culturing.\n        But now that the embryos were all affixed and Rafael was not here to \n        hypocritically chide her for the habit, she left the pack of cigs on \n        the table as if one would not be enough for this conversation.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        She sent her drink order with a glance, and it came in a flat-bottomed\n        glass.
